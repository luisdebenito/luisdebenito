  Since I started programming in 2013, I have never stopped developing my own
  stuff just for fun.

  using <b>Angular</b> & <b>Capacitor</b>.

<p>
  I have created a social network (<b>puebleo</b>), a trivia question game
  called askIt, a php framework to work with html as jQuery does, and a lot of
  different videogames, here are some videos explaining the projects (most are
  in Spanish)

<div *ngFor="let item of videourls" class="video-tuto">
  <p>{{ item.title }}</p>
  <iframe
    width="560"
    height="315"
    [src]="item.url"
    [title]="item.title"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
    allowfullscreen
  ></iframe>
</div>
