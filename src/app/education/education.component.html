<h1>University in Madrid</h1>
<p>
  After a good childhood in the fields, it was my time to move to the big city.
  I got into UPM (Universidad Polit√©cnica de Madrid) to study
  <b>Electronic and Automatic Industrial Engineering</b>

<h1>University of London</h1>
<p>
  Lucky me, I got sponsored to do an online MSC in Data Science and Artificial
  Intelligence. It was nice, but not what I expected, easily replaced by Youtube

<h1>Volunteering</h1>
<p>
  I have done a lot of volunteering, but Malta was the best one. I got the
  chance to develop a project to handcraft instruments made by trash, and spent
  a couple months enjoying the views

<h1>Others</h1>
<p>
  I got the national tennis teacher license from RFET, did a quarterly exchange
  in Ames, Iowa, and some other titles that may be interesting for nobody.
