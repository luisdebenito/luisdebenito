<i>Volevo imparare, ho imparato</i>
<p>
  I was hired by Electrolux as a <b>Tools Development Engineer in the GEP</b>.
  Long name, amazing experience. I got the chance to learn Italian and meet
  people from all around the world. I lived on my second and third languages for
  a year and a half, and it was incredible
