<i>Volevo imparare, ho imparato</i>

  I was hired by <b>Electrolux</b> as a Tools Development Engineer in the GEP.
  Long name, amazing experience. I got the chance to learn Italian and meet
  people from all around the world. I lived on my second and third languages for
  a year and a half, and it was incredible
